Small Pig Game Project

Combination of switching CSS classes with JavaScript. 
Game is played between 2 players. Player is rolling the dice and the value of dice is summed everytime the dice is rolled ("Current").
Player's turn is as long as he doesn't roll the 1.
The moment the current player rolls 1, he losts all the current (summed) value of rolls (it becomes 0), and the other players gets his turn.
Every player has a chance to hold the current sum value and then pass the turn to the other player.
The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.
